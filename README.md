# Faye Spell

Faye Spell is a simple Ionic Framework based mobile application created to help my daughter with her spelling assignments at school. It uses a text to speech cordova plugin to say a sentence using the requested word.

This uses Ionic Framework 1 and thus uses AngularJS 1 as well, so be warned, it's ancient!

The in-app word list is grabbed from a simple API which I would update as and when words were added to Faye's homework list.

For what it's worth the icon was created in Inkscape!
